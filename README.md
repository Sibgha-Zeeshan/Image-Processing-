# Image-Processing-
Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computer science. we have explore the mapping of matrix chain multiplication to the context of image processing, specifically for RGB image reconstruction. The central objective of this research is to explore an application of Dynamic Programming
